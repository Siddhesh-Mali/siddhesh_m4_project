    <!-- Make a simple form by executing the following event handlers and on Change functions.
    For Email - make an onChange function to check if the value of input has more than 3 characters or not and if it contains "@" and "."
    Similarly Password should be more than 8 characters, make an onChange function for the same.
    As soon as the email and password pass the check make sure to remove the red errors and show a green text saying all good to go.
    On click of the submit button throw a confirmation window and if the user presses okay, then throw an alert saying successful signup!
    Else redirect them to the same page and clear all the input values. -->
